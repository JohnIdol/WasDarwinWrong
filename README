This is my half-arsed dodgy javascript implementation of the *hello world* of genetic algorithms.

I developed this as a joke when somebody asks me to "prove" evolution works.

It's the same algorithm I used on TypingMonkey --> [ http://github.com/JohnIdol/typingmonkey ]

Note: I am using mutation in this example but it seems to be rather ininfluent.
