This is my half-arsed dodgy javascript implementation of the *hello world* of genetic algorithms.

I developed this as a joke to make fun of creationists, even though I realize such an ignorant kind would not appreciate the tautologic implications of what I am showing them.

It's the same algorithm I used on TypingMonkey --> [ http://github.com/JohnIdol/typingmonkey ]

Note: I am using mutation in this example but it is rather useless.
